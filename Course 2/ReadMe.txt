Determining the order of nucleotides in a genome, or genome sequencing, presents a fundamental task in bioinformatics. Genomes vary in length; your own genome is roughly 3 billion nucleotides long, whereas the genome of Amoeba dubia, an amorphous unicellular organism, is approximately 200 times longer! This unicellular organism competes with the rare Japanese flower Paris japonica for the title of species with the longest genome.

The first sequenced genome, belonging to a Ï†X174 bacterial phage (i.e., a virus that preys on bacteria), had only 5,386 nucleotides and was completed in 1977 by Frederick Sanger. Four decades after this Nobel Prize-winning discovery, genome sequencing has raced to the forefront of bioinformatics research, as the cost of sequencing plummeted. Because of the decreasing cost of sequencing, we now have thousands of sequenced genomes, including those of many mammals (see below).

To sequence a genome, we must clear some practical hurdles. The largest obstacle is the fact that biologists still lack the technology to read the nucleotides of a genome from beginning to end in the same way that you would read a book. The best they can do is sequence much shorter DNA fragments called reads. The reasons why researchers can sequence small pieces of DNA but not long genomes warrant their own discussion.
